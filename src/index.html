          <h2>Hi there!</h2>

          <p>
            I&apos;m building Upstand FM because I want to explore if
            there&apos;s a better way to do standups when working remotely.
          </p>

          <h3 class="content-header">What does "async" mean?</h3>

          <p>
            It&apos;s short for asynchronous. And in this context it refers to
            "how" we communicate within the team.
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast, synchronous communication usually refers to an
            immediate "face-to-face" exchange of information. Like having a
            meeting with people that are all present in the same room.
          </p>

          <p>
            Asynchronous communication usually refers to an exchange of
            information that happens over time. Like sending and receiving
            emails. Here, a response doesn&apos;t have to (nor is expected to!)
            be immediate.
          </p>

          <h3 class="content-header">What&apos;s a standup?</h3>

          <p>
            It&apos;s a common ritual among agile/scrum teams. Usually every day
            all team members will gather in person, and everyone will answer 3
            questions:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>What did you work on yesterday?</li>
            <li>What will you work on today?</li>
            <li>Is there anything that prevents you from doing your work?</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            After everyone answers these questions (usually referred to as "the
            update") work will resume (in theory
            <span
              role="img"
              aria-label="grinning face with aquinting eyes and sweat drop"
            >
              ðŸ˜…</span
            >).
          </p>

          <h3 class="content-header">Why are standups useful?</h3>

          <p>
            Because they make the team aware of what everyone is working on, and
            what they might be struggling with.
          </p>

          <p>
            In general, standups improve the flow of information. They help
            participants with getting a deeper understanding of the problem
            space they are working in. They stimulate everyone to help each
            other, and share/synchronize their understanding of shared goals.
          </p>

          <h3 class="content-header">What&apos;s the problem then?</h3>

          <p>
            The problem is that a fixed time must be picked for the entire team
            to be available. And the actual time the standup takes place often
            disrupts people&apos;s workflow&mdash;due to context switching,
            "deep work" interference and scheduling conflicts.<br />
            These problems also tend to be more prominent in a remote working
            environment, where people have different "work rhythms", because of
            personal preference and/or timezone differences.
          </p>

          <p>Other issues with the traditional synchronous standup are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Discussions during the standup are common (sidebar!).</li>

            <li>
              Participants can "zone out", get distracted or loose interest.
            </li>

            <li>There&apos;s no efficient way to "replay" the standup.</li>

            <li>There&apos;s usually no record of previous standups.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            What if team members could easily share- and listen to daily
            updates, at a time that works best for them?
          </p>

          <h3 class="content-header">How?</h3>

          <p>Stay <b>tuned</b> for updates!</p>
