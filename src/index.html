        <h2>Hi there!</h2>

        <p>
          I&apos;m building Upstand FM because I want to explore if there&apos;s
          a better way to do standups when working remotely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Signups are <b>disabled</b> at the moment, because I just started
          working on this and the app is not usable yet. But if you&apos;d like
          access, learn more, or just say hello, send me (DaniÃ«l) an email to{'
          '}

        <h2>What does "async" mean?</h2>

        <p>
          Async is short for asynchronous. And in this context it refers to
          "how" we communicate within the team.
        </p>

        <p>
          In contrast, synchronous communication usually refers to a
          "face-to-face" exchange of information. Like having a meeting with
          people that are all present in the same room, or doing a conference
          call.
          <br />
          Everyone is (supposed to be) actively listening while the meeting
          takes place. And when someone asks you a question, you&apos;ll
          (usually) respond immediately, as part of the conversation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Asynchronous communication usually refers to an exchange of
          information that happens over time. Like sending and receiving emails,
          or chat messages.
          <br />
          Here, a response doesn&apos;t have to (nor is expected to!) be
          immediate.
        </p>

        <h2>What&apos;s a standup?</h2>

        <p>
          It&apos;s a common ritual among agile/scrum teams. Usually every day
          all team members will gather in person, and each person will answer 3
          questions:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>What did you work on yesterday?</li>
          <li>What will you work on today?</li>
          <li>Do you have any impediments?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          After each team member answers these questions&mdash;usually referred
          to as "the update"&mdash;work will resume (in theory{' '}
          <span
            role="img"
            aria-label="grinning face with aquinting eyes and sweat drop"
          >
            ðŸ˜…
          </span>
          ).
        </p>

        <h2>Why are standups useful?</h2>

        <p>
          When executed correctly, standups make the team aware of what everyone
          is working on, and what they might be struggling with.
        </p>

        <p>
          In general, standups improve the flow of information. They help
          participants with getting a deeper understanding of the problem space
          they are working in. They also stimulate everyone to help each other,
          and share/synchronize their understanding of shared goals.
        </p>

        <h2>What&apos;s the problem then?</h2>

        <p>
          Well, a fixed time must be picked for the entire team to be available.
          This is especially difficult for distributed teams that work remotely
          (usually due to timezone differences).
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, the actual time the standup takes place can interfere
          with people&apos;s schedule, and disrupt someone&apos;s
          workflow&mdash;due to context switching and "deep work" interference.
          This problem tends to be more prominent in a remote working
          environment, where people have different rhythms (because of personal
          preference and/or timezone difference).
        </p>

        <p>Other issues are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Discussions during the standup are common (sidebar!).</li>

          <li>
            Participants can "zone out", get distracted or loose interest.
          </li>

          <li>There&apos;s no efficient way to "replay" the standup.</li>

          <li>There&apos;s usually no record of previous standups.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          What if team members could easily share- and listen to daily standup
          updates, when it&apos;s most convenient for them?
        </p>
